# Railgun

A single-tap keybinder tool for NationStates raiding

## Keybinds
The keybinds of Railgun are similar to those of YAFFeather, so going from one to the other should be familiar. 
The current list of implemented keybinds is: 

- A - Refresh the current page
- F - Move to the current region

## DISCLAIMER

This tool is not like Feather - instead of clicking buttons on the page, this extension creates and sends custom HTTPS requests to the NationStates server. 
This approach allows for speeding up certain activities, such as appointing ROs in a single keypress. However, this is *inherently riskier* than simple keybinding, as the chance for the developer to screw up the rules is magnified exponentially.
The developer of Railgun has made every effort to comply with NationStates rules, but mistakes do happen - the developer is not responsible for any unintended or erroneous program behavior that breaks these rules. By using Railgun, you acknowledge that you understand and accept the inherent risks present in using such a tool.
